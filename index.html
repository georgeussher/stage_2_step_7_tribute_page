  <h1 id= "title"> Soundsystem Culture </h1>
  <h2 id= "subtitle"> A brief history of the movement </h2>
  <p> This is the story of a culture born from immigration, whose roots can be traced back to 40's and 50's Jamaica and not long after it was brought to the UK to flourish. The 'rigs' may have got bigger and the music faster but the basic idea has remained the same; loud music and a wall of speakers bringing people together.</p>

    <h2>Heres a timeine of the movement in the UK following its  introduction from Jamaica:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Soundsystems were brought over from Jamaica during the Windrush era of immigration in the 1950's and 1960s </li><br>
      <li> Due to the radio stations at the time refusing to play reggae music and the unwelcoming nature of clubs and pubs to Jamaicans at the time, they began to carve out their own nich√©. </li><br>
        <li> In 1973, the organiser of the largley Trinidad-and-Tobago event Notting Hill Carnival introduced soundsystems wanting a "Jamaican sound" to be represented at the festival.</li><br>
          <li> By the 80's there were several soundsystems up and down the country with a heavy focus on reggae and dub. </li><br>
          <li> In the 90s Jungle music came onto the scene, characterised by fast drum patterns and heavy basslines, gaining popularity and pushing Dub and Reggae to the sidelines </li><br>
          <li> Through the 90's and into the 2000's, free parties- illegal parties held on private and public land without authorisation flourished. A wide variety of dance music was played and the soundsystem was central to the phenomenom. </li><br>
          <li> Today, there are hundreds of soundsystems across the UK, playing in clubs, streets and fields with music from Hardcore and Tekno through to Dub and Dancehall shaking the air. </li><br>
    </ul>
